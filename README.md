# Quantum Hackathon - University of Pisa

## Introduction
This repository contains materials and solutions from a quantum hackathon organized by PhD students of the University of Pisa. The event was aimed at introducing quantum computing concepts to students from the Departments of Physics, Computer Science, and Engineering. The hackathon provided a hands-on experience with quantum programming, leveraging Python and Qiskit.

### Notebooks
- **NB1: My First Approach to Quantum Computing**  
  A beginner-friendly introduction to quantum programming concepts.
  
- **NB2: Practical Exercises**  
  The exercises, written in Italian, focus on building quantum circuits and oracles to achieve specific quantum states upon measurement. Participants developed solutions that demonstrate practical quantum programming techniques.

## What I Learned
1. How to program quantum circuits using Python and Qiskit.  
2. How to locally simulate the execution of a quantum circuit.  
3. How to run a quantum circuit on IBM Quantum's real quantum hardware in the cloud.  
4. How to interpret results from quantum experiments.

## Take-Home Message
Developing quantum circuits is an art that requires a solid theoretical foundation and extensive practice. Software and hardware tools like Qiskit can guide developers in exploring quantum programming. However, substantial research is still needed to establish robust techniques in quantum software engineering.
